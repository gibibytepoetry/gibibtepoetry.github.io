        <pre>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
​
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
​
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
​
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

A little bread—a crust—a crumb— 
A little trust—a demijohn— 
Can keep the soul alive— 
Not portly, mind! but breathing—warm— 
Conscious—as old Napoleon, 
The night before the Crown! 
​
A modest lot—A fame petite— 
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet 
Is plenty! Is enough! 
A Sailor's business is the shore! 
A Soldier's—balls! Who asketh more, 
Must seek the neighboring life!
​
